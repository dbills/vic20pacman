for debugging, here are the keyboard read codes for the ghost control

tile scrolling works
we allow going to 8 or 0 which always allows to make it to the end of a tile set
so if you are heading towards a wall, you will always be able to touch it
when you start in the new tile after a course scroll it's always 1 or 7

        I'm doing a little gueswork here for the elroy mode table above
        which only listed the ghost speeds, I'm assuming those correspond to the
        stock ghost speeds as mentioned in the table above it for ghost speeds
        therefore, it looks like Blinky's elroy behavior change for each of the
        first three levels, and then we would just skip it? since even his elroy
        speed is the same as the regular ghosts?

        the elroy dots should maybe be corrected for the different dotcount in my port?  real game has 240 dots mine has 164
        corrected: 20 = 13, 30=20, 40 = 27
        
        napkin calculation for above percentages:
        60 FPS * .71 = 42.6 present
        * 10 to get rid of floating point
        426/600 present = 142/200 present
        200-142 = 58 skipped
        200/58 = fraction = 3.44
        We'll use integer addition with error correction
        add 58, each time we > 200 , the emit an error signal ( skip a frame )
        and take N-200 to generate the next number in the sequence
        e.g. the sequence 58,116,174,32,90,148, 6,64,122,180
                                      X         X
        you can see the sequence varies between runs of 2 and 3 continuous
        frames, which does net out 58 skipped frames over 200 as we desire

        in the table above I've put the denominator for each speed
        
11/6/17 x ghost should not reverse direction right away when the mode changes, but rather when they enter the next tile
        x eating an energizer stop pacman moving for three frames
        ghosts leaving the house direction does not match the arcade game

        cruise elroy mode, blink's scatter mode should change to he still chases you
        if after blinky has become elroy, you die, he only remains normal  until Clyde comes out
        then it's back to elroy again

        at level 19 ghosts should stop turning blue

TODO:
        blinky hot pursuit mode is not functioning properly
        I can get into areas of the maze where blinky can't get to me
        e.g. upper spot of lower left upside down T on the right side
        while blinky continuually laps the left upside down L
        special areas of maze where ghosts can't make certain turns
        x get doteatn speed reduction working
        x scatter timer doesn't run when frightened
        x get 3 frame pause working ( animation flaws)
        x timer for clyde is broken on level1
        get rid of setting color for clyde when he is pursuing vs fleeing
        try doubling sound interrupt level
        get intermission
        agonizer needs visited ( are we reducing the power pill time correctly)
